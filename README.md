# Multi_type_Transferable_Method
Since the data file uploaded to github is too large, the following two steps need to be run

First, you need to run dealWith_data.py to obtain embedding of node2vec in four datasets
```python
python dealWith_data.py
```
Second, you need to run Multi_type_Transferable_Method.py
```python
python Multi_type_Transferable_Method.py
```
